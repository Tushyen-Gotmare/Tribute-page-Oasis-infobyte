                    Stephen Hawking helped demolish the steady-state theory of the universe, which claimed that the expanding cosmos was forever being filled with fresh matter. He found that black holes were not so black, and instead could emit radiation. He developed the concept of "imaginary time", and argued it made no sense to talk of a time before the universe began: to ask what happened before the beginning of the universe is as meaningless as asking what is south of the South Pole. This is not a book to learn Hawking's science from, but it is an introduction to the cosmos he unveiled.
